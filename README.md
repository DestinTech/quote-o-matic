## Quote-o-Matic

### How I worked on this project

- I designed this project a few years ago on codepen [link](https://codepen.io/destintech-the-reactor/pen/ExXormm)
- I installed webpack, babel and set up the package.json according to this [guide](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-publish-your-react-component-package-to-npm-20ee4f81a506)
- I configured webpack to pack css modules according to this [guide](https://elfi-y.medium.com/webpack-with-css-modules-93caa1062baa)
- I refactored my code to use react components. :relieved:
